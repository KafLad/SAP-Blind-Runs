<h1 align="center"> Usage </h1>
<p> As of v1.1, the program is currently only usable on either a Framework laptop or my personal custom desktop setup. The first thing on the To-Do list of updates is dynamic screen identification. However, the project was pushed to public visibilty for anyone interested to see the progress of the bot and how development has progressed. Also since it is technically usable at the moment, however, only on specific hardware. </p>
